Many ThinkPads still use Lenovo's 'slim tip' charging port.  Recent advances allow for USBC charging. This means you can  replace the bulky ThinkPad charger with a more versatile and compact USBC one.

## Embrace a Lighter Charging Solution

### The Charger

Choose a high-quality GaN USBC charger, capable of delivering the power your ThinkPad needs (e.g., 135W or more). Ensure the charger's output matches or exceeds your laptop's requirements.

> Tip: For multi-port chargers, confirm at least one port supports the needed power output.

### The USBC Cable

Standard USBC cables won't suffice, as they can't handle higher power. Buy a USBC cable rated for 240W, or at least for the power your ThinkPad requires. These cables are typically thicker and more costly, but necessary. Unless the GaN charger detects the cable is capable of higher power, the charger will limit itself to only 60W and the ThinkPad will not charge.

### The Slim Tip to USBC Adapter

Opt for an adapter or a short cable, ensuring it's rated for your ThinkPad's power needs. Avoid low-rated options.

## Conclusion

By selecting the right charger, cable, and adapter, you can streamline your ThinkPad's charging setup with USBC, saving weight and space in your backpack.
