The Snipping Tool in Windows 11, 2024, has a problem with the save location.  The default location is the `Pictures > Screenshots` folder.  Also the tool does not remember the last location used, unlike older versions of the Snipping Tool.

This is cumbersome if you want to save to a different location, such as `Desktop`.  Here is how to fix it.

<!--more-->

1. Open the Snipping Tool.
2. Click on the three dots menu in the top right corner.
3. Select `Settings`.
4. Uncheck the setting `Automatically save screenshots`.
5. Recommended: enable `Ask to save edited screenshots`, for safety.

Now, when you take a screenshot and click on the pop-up, you will be prompted to save it, and the save location will be `Desktop`.  If you change to another folder, that will be remembered for next time.
